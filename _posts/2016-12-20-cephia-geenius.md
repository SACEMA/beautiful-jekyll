The Bio-Rad Geenius HIV1/2 Supplemental Assay, sometimes referred to as a rapid test version of an HIV Western Blot, provides multiple bands of reactivity which are read under standard lighting conditions. An extensive CEPHIA evaluation of an off-label use of (based on research-only access to) the individual band intensities suggests that there is sufficient dynamic in this platform for uses other than diagnosis – namely infection staging for incidence, are feasible, and could be further explored.
